# DirSync

## üìã About

**DirSync** is a simple C# console app that syncs two folders: **source** and **replica**.  
It makes sure the **replica** folder is always a mirror of the **source** folder with one-way sync. The app runs on a set interval, handling file copying, deletions, and errors, all while keeping a log of what's going and optional archiving just in case.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- One-way synchronization from source to replica
- Periodic sync at custom intervals
- Logs operations to both console and files
- Supports interactive and non-interactive modes
- Optional file archiving before deletion
- Robust config validation and CLI argument parsing

### üèÅ Usage

<br>

During the first launch, the config.json will be created in the executable directory. On subsequent launches, the app will attempt to use this existing configuration file.
Config example:
```bash
{
  "SourcePath": "D:\\Test\\Origin",
  "ReplicaPath": "D:\\Test\\Target",
  "LogFilePath": "D:\\Test\\",
  "SyncIntervalSeconds": 1800,
  "ArchiveEnabled": false
}
```
<br>


‚ñ∂Ô∏è **One-liner (non-interactive):** 
```bash
.\DirSync.exe --source=C:\Source --replica=D:\Replica --logs=C:\Logs --interval=3600 --archive=true
```
If valid config file is available arguments can be skipped. If specified, new data will be entered into config file.
```bash
.\DirSync.exe --replica=D:\NewReplica
```
<br>

üßë‚Äçüíª **Interactive mode (guided setup):**
```bash
.\DirSync.exe --i
```

<br>

### üìö Additional Information
- Each synchronization session generates its own dedicated log and archive folder. Only if there is something to log or archive.
- During synchronization, the app will recreate the folder structure for any files being backed up.
- If the app is unable to complete the sync before the specified interval ends, it will notify the user of the delay upon sync completion and immediately start the next synchronization session.
